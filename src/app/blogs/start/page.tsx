        Let&apos;s suppose that you are convinced now let&apos;s move to the
        next question
        <h2>What should I write about and how i can find good topic?</h2>
        The easy way is to start from you own experience, did you learn
        something new recently? did you fix a bug? did you build something cool?
        if the answer is yes, then you have a topic to write about. <br />
        Don&apos;t try to be unique, As a beginner, you need to focus on
        improving your writing skills before trying to write about something
        unique. <br />
        <h2>Where should I publish my blog?</h2>
        There are many platforms that you can use to publish your blog, or
        probably you want to create your own blog from scratch <br />
        We recommend you start with blogging platform instead of trying to
        create your own blog for a simple reason: people tend to procrastinate
        as it require more effort to create your own blog from scratch. <br />
